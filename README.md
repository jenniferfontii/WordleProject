# WordleProject
I wanted to create a program in C++ that recreates the famous New York Times’ game Wordle. Wordle is a word puzzle game where you must guess a different 5 letter word each time you play. Every time that a word is inserted by the user the program checks if any of the letters is present in the guess, if it is and it’s in the right position the letter is going to become green, if it’s present but not in the right position it is going to become yellow and lastly, it it’s not present it is going to turn grey.
